# Obirn's dotfile

This repository contains my personal **configuration files**.

## Table of contents
1. [Vimrc](#vimrc)
2. [i3](#i3)
3. [nvim](#nvim)

# Vimrc
First of all, if not done, clone the repository in the tmp folder (So that it will be deleted on reboot)
`git clone git@github.com:obirn/dotfiles.git /tmp`

Then, copy the .vimrc file in your folder:
`cp /tmp/dotfiles/vimrc ~/.vimrc`

Here you go, now you should have the vimrc file in your configuration.
